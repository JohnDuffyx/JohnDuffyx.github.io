<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny distinctions in temperature.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
