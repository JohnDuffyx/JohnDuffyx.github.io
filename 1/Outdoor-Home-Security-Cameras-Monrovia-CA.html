<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera in Monrovia CA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

The handsome shiny black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine was available in a lovely rose-gold but you can also get it in silver) strikes the ideal balance between good-looking and subtle enough to not draw attention to itself.</p>
