<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
