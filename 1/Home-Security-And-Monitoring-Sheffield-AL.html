<p>Frequently a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. However, the two are considerably various.

It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control panel (likewise known as the alarm panel).

Also a local alarm will not call the authorities; it simply triggers an audible siren to signal people close by.</p>
