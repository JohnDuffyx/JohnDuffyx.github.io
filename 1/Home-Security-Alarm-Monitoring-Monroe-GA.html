<h3>Office Security Systems Monroe GA 30655</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate inside your home or inside - you get a lot of versatility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is easy to install. That's just $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>
