We initially observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
