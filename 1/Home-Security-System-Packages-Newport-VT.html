All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present recommendation.</p>
