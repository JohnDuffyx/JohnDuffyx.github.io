<p>First and foremost, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of day, usage and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.

The app is slick and nice, complimenting the camera's own cool style, and you can manage the Circle by means of Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or among Logitech's Pop clever home buttons.</p>

The highest image quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
