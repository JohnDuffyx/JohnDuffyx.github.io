If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which indicates. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>

Incorrect home network configurations, flaws in the devices or password compromise might permit a hacker to break into the system and figure out if anyone is home, or even take control.
