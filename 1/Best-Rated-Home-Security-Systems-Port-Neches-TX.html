<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the porch by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
