It's simple to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be installed practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it communicates with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, in addition to various third-party smart- home gadgets.
