<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific option for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, given that the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly protects information by preventing it from being sent.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>
