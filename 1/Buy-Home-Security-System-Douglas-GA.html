<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level.
