<p>To evaluate response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security guard. Numerous cities likewise need a permit to even run a home and own security system.

The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
