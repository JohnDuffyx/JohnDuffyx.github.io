The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is in between recording and detecting motion. Since the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to really switch on when it spots motion.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more pricey for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with repaired lens are usually smaller than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most remarkable response time of all home security companies we evaluated. Their timeframe for action in under 10 seconds, which we need to confess is rather impressive.
