A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small differences in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level differences. Because objects are seldom specifically the very same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can detect them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
