<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person reaches the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
