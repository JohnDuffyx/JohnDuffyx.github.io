<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm.

Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten trespassers in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a broken window to require authorities reaction.</p>
