<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control board (normally positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have been set off, clever alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been triggered, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly frustrating your neighbours).
