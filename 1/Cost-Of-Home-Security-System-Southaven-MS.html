<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Applications for alarm authorizations are readily available at the Police headquarters. Please call the Cops Department for an Alarm Authorization Application if you are setting up a new alarm.
