<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even set off incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT irritates us. We see so many growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies extensively depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
