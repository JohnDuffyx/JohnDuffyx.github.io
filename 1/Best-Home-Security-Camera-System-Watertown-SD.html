<p>To evaluate reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security personnel. A number of cities also need an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
