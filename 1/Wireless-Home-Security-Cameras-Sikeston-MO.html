<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
