<p>Wireless cameras can be an exceptional option for a video surveillance system.

<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set amount of time, generally one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement. Spending for the equipment up front offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as many times as you desire.</p>
