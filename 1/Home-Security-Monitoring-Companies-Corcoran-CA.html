<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera whenever. They're excellent for storage facilities.

Which, you imagine, would be enough to send even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
