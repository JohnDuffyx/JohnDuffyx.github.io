<p>We searched for DIY systems that provided expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement.

<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
