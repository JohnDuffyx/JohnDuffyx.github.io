<p>We searched for DIY systems that provided expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement.

Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
