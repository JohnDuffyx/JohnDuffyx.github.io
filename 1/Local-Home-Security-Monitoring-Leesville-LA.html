<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both people and animals. Considering that carbon monoxide gas is odor-free and colorless, the only way to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your home increases to a dangerous level. With a wireless system, you can also get push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a concern, even when you're not at home.</p>

We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
