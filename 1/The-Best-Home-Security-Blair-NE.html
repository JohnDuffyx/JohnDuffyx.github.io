<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the bill. It ships with four sleek and white bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor usage. They're geared up with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and clever IR to offer up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app periodically forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
