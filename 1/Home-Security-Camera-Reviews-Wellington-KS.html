<p>SmartThings was also a previous candidate. Nevertheless, it needs a good deal of effort to get the system to operate as a home security system. While it provides wonderful imagination, it will need more effort than the present top choices. Also, the app remains difficult to browse, though they are moving users to a more recent app called 'SmartThings Link' which has potential.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of night, day and use images have always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.
