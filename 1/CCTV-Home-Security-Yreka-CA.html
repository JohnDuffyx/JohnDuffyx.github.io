<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
