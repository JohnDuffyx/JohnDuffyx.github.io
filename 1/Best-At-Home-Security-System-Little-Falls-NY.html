The other noteworthy things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo model which I'm going to talk about in just a 2nd), it is developed for outdoor as well as indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine. It likewise has a USB slot so you can tape your video directly onto there, which conserves you needing to handle the cloud storage system described above.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm that needed expert installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, use equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, included typically burdensome and long contracts, and frequently depend on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they provide little benefit. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated individually and do not recommend for many people.</p>

At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm should suffice to frighten intruders in most cases.
