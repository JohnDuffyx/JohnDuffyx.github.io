<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see precisely when a specific individual reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
