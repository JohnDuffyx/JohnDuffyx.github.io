<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
