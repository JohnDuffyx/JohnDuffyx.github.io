<h2>Outdoor Surveillance Cameras Central Point</h2>

<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
