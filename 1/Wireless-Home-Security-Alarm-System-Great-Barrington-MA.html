<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
