<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are clearly not prevented by video cameras - and may even be brought in to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the restricted benefits that the system may offer in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

It is necessary to keep in mind that in some locations you may have to declare a license to have a security system set up in your home.</p>
