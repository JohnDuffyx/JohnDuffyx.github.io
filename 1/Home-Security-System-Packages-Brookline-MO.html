<p>CCTV security cameras, otherwise referred to as closed-circuit television, are a system of video feeds within a closed system available only to licensed users. Given that their origin in the mid-20th century, CCTV cameras have actually evolved to use high frame rates, enabling a user to follow the movement of someone on camera. In addition, high resolution allows for full-color feeds and extremely detailed pictures along with night vision capabilities. There are a range of CCTV camera types and requirements on the market.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>Night vision: Many burglaries take place after dark, so this feature is almost as crucial as motion detection. Technically, most home security cameras support infrared LED lighting, versus true night vision based on image surge or thermal vision.

The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of image required or desired). The greatest photo quality of DVD is just slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
