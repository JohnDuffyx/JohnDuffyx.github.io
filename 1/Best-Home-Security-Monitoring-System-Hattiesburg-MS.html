For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to function optimally.</p>
<p>One of the many benefits of installing wireless security systems is 'versatile installation'. With these systems, it's simple to mount the security cameras on practically any surface and you might not worry about the positioning of the DVR too.

What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like intense sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain circumstances such as nanny cameras or signing in on a family pet, though when looking to collect proof of a criminal offense they often come up short.</p>
<p>Wireless home security systems require batteries. For that reason, you will have to check and change the batteries occasionally, which takes more time, effort, and money.
