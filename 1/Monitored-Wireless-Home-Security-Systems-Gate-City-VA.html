<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
