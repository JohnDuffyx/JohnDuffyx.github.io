<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of approximately one year of battery life.

We have actually observed some enhancements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this evaluation and test, as needed.</p>

A combination of both can typically be a good strategy, too. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
