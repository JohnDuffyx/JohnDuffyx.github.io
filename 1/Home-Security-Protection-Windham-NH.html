<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the entire community. And it doesn't cost that much more to dress up your system with doorbell cameras, floodlights, and outdoor security cameras.

<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It triggers the doorbell camera when someone sounds the doorbell.
