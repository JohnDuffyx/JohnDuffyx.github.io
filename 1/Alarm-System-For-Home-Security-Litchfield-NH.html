<h3>Wireless Camera Security System Litchfield NH 03052</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send informs, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
