<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

Just bought a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Excellent clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my cellular phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly recommend this company.</p>
