To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video or a damaged window to necessitate authorities action.</p>
