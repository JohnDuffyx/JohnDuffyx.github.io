<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
