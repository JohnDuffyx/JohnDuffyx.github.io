<h2>The Benefits Of Having CCTV Surveillance Lyndhurst</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system normally included a number of cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor.

Whether you have one camera or a number of, they work with your home's internet network to send out video footage right to your computer system or mobile phone. A lot of consumer cameras save information internally, on a detachable microSD card, or from another location on the cloud.</p>

An image of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating occurs.</p>
