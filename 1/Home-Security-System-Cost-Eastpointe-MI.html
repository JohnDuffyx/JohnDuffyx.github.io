<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
