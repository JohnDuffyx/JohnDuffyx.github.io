And, many subscription plans also consist of extra functions, such as custom-made motion zones.</p>

There's two-way talking, quick actions to remote commands, fast zooming, and an adjustable field of view. The app is nice and slick, complimenting the camera's own cool design, and you can manage the Circle via Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or among Logitech's Pop clever home buttons.</p>
