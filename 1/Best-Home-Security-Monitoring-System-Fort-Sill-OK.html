Another big feature is night vision. You might also consider a camera with a built-in motion-activated light-- all the better to scare you with, my dear!

<p>The greatest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets set off while you're away, you have no visual means of confirming if something is actually incorrect and how serious the circumstance is.

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
