<h3>Digital Security Systems Germantown WI 53022</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
