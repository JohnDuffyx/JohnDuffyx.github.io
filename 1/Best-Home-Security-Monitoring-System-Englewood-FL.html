We first saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.
