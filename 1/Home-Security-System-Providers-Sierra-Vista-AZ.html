<p>You use a keypad to manually arm and disarm your home security system. Like a lot of wireless security equipment, keypads can be set up anywhere you want.

And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>

However that can leave your home more susceptible due to the fact that you won't have experts enjoying all the time.</p>
