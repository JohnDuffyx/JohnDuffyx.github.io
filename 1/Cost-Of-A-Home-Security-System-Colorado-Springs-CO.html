The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically two years of day, night and use images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We've seen it highlight moths, mice, and vehicles.</p>

<p>During our testing, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look.

For less than $400, you get two door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
