<p>Think about it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It just does not build up. To offer such low prices, manufacturers need to cut corners, and completion result is compromised performance.
