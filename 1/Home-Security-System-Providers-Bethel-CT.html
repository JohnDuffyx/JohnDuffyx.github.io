<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup procedure. This generally involves discovering a spot for your camera, developing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. A lot of them then allow you to set up the alert frequency and develop activity monitoring zones, so the camera will capture motion just in designated areas-- a function we find essential for high-traffic locations, which could set off a lot of false signals.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
