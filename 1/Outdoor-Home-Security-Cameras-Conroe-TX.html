<p>The very best in smart home security systems. Life can get hectic often, and it can be challenging keeping an eye on everything around you. Luckily, a surveillance camera can lend an extra set of eyes and act as lookout for you and your household. Surveillance cameras are video cameras used to record the activity of the environment in which they are put, usually for usage in conjunction with security measures. The movie is typically tape-recorded and able to be shown and repeated on a monitor.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with a tempting chance for criminal misuse.

By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and researching the backgrounds of the vehicles' owners, he tried to blackmail clients who were married. Picture what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that obviously they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too pricey, and not great.</p>
