We love that it features both internal and external sirens and will even deal with Philips Color clever lights, too. The directions are very comprehensive and the 200m range of the alarm means it can be used to safeguard garages and sheds in addition to your home. The alarm doesn't include a wifi security camera however you can acquire a variety of different Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional bonus.
