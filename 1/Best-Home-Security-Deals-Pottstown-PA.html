<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set quantity of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more common.
