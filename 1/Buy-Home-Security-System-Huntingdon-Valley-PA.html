We like that you can utilize the Blue by ADT mobile app with no tricky fineprint or extra charges. Other ADT home security offerings need a monitoring plan update to get remote control through an app. With Blue, you get the app from the start-- whether you include expert monitoring or not.</p>
<p>Spend some time to check out online reviews and not simply those on the company's site. Take a look at the Better Business Bureau website specifically.
