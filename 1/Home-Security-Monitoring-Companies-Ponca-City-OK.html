<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.
