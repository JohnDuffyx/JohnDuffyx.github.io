<h3>Wireless Home Alarm Monitoring Baden PA 15005</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that permits you to zoom in and record details such as facial features in case of burglaries.</p>
