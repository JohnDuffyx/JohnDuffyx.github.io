<p>Thank you men for the assistance, what fantastic client servcie you use. I purchased a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am pretty useful to install it myself. I called in for some technical help and they were pleasant and got right to the point of me shooting up the system when it came to the last setup. They even called back, the next day to check that everything was still on track.</p>

The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are linked to has a hard drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system. If your handling taped video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use disk drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of hard disk drive malfunction.</p>

<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
