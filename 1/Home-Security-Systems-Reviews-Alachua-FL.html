<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is bad. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
