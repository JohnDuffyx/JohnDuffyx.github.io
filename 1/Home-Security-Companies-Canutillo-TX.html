<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the specific same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
