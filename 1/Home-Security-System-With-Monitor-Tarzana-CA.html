<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person comes to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has actually expanded its security variety with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99).

In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to distinguish between a vehicle and an individual, for example, permits you to cut down on unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
