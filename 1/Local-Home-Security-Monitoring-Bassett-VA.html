<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
