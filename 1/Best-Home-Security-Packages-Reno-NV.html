<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
