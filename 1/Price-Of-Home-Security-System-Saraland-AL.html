<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
