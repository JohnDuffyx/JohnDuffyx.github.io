<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
