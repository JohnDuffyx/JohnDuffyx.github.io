Your alarm company is needed to collect the alarm license fee and acquire the alarm authorization on the Alarm Registration and False Alarm Management (ARFAM) website The charge is $25.00 for residential and $50.00 for commercial alarm owners.

And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the month-to-month strategy, the latter of which is waived for the first year.
