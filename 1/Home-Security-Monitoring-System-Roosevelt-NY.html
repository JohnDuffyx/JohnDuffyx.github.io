We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
