If there are no as-built files providing performance and configuration info to make this integration work, there are just two options. The very first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or unwilling to supply those details) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.

<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was developed for house owners.
