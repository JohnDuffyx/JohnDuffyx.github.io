<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
