There were relatively couple of dangers when wireless technology was initially presented. Hackers had not yet had time to latch on to the new technology, and wireless networks were not typically found in the work place. However, there are many security threats related to the current wireless procedures and file encryption methods, and in the recklessness and ignorance that exists at the user and business IT level. 4 Hacking approaches have actually become much more sophisticated and innovative with wireless gain access to.
