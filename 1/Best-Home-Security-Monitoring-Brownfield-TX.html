<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Commercial properties tend to have even higher incorrect alarm rates than residential properties since more individuals tend to share responsibility for triggering and deactivating the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complex. The rate of incorrect alarms for commercial alarm users may be as much as 3 times greater than the rate of false alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Persistent incorrect alarm activations are often due to inadequate worker training or inferior systems that have not been updated.</p>

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
