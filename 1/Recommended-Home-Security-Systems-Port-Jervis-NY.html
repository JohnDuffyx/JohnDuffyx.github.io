<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have extra sensors and essential fobs, too.</p>
