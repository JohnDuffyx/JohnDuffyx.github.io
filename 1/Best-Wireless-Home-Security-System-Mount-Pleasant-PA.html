<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
