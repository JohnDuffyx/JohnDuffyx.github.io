<p>As a Contributing Editor for PCMag, John Delaney has been evaluating and examining monitors, Televisions, PCs, networking and smart home equipment, and other assorted hardware and peripherals for practically 20 years. A 13-year veteran of PC Publication's Labs (most recently as Director of Operations), John was accountable for the recruitment, training and management of the Labs technical staff, along with examining and maintaining the stability of the Labs screening devices and treatments.

<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's lawn indication monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company initially explored home security in 2011, and its signature red yard sign is almost as common as ADT's traditional blue. The best reason to opt for Xfinity might be that you're already a Comcast client. Bundling unlocks for deals, and makes your regular monthly costs paying that much easier.

Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of an interruption, but long term blackouts will result in the system losing power. It's also crucial to think about the length of time you plan to stay at the same residence when selecting a wired system.
