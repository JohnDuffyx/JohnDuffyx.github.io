<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to require to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are variety problems.</p>
