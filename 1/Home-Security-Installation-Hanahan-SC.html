<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>While the majority of companies offer you the choice to include both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security plan, SimpliSafe's choice is restricted to one indoor surveillance camera.
