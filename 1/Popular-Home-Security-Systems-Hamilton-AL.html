<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more economical subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is a costly security camera, but we think it deserves the financial investment. Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of websites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
