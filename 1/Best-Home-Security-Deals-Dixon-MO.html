<h3>Home Surveillance Cameras Dixon MO 65459</h3>
<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually found intruders or wild animals. Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens might violate local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something activates your alarm but you remain in a conference with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service implies you don't get alerted till the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise may scare off would-be trespassers-- if you're fortunate. But the cops will not come until you personally call them. </p>
