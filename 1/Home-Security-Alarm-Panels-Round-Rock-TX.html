<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see precisely when a particular person comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.
