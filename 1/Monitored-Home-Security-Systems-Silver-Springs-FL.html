<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
