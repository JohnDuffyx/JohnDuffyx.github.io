When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
