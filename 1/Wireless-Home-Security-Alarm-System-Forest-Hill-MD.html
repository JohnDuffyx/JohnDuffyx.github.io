<h3>Home Alarm System Companies Forest Hill MD 21050</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm system has four smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your location. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that reduces all blind areas and offers you access to a wider field of view than many cameras. It is likewise equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that allows you to focus and record information such as facial functions in case of burglaries.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the client service experience varies widely depending on the dealership you choose. </p>
