<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
