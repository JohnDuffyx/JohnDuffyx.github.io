<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a bit of an issue is in between spotting and tape-recording movement.

The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who happens to be my partner).
