<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
