<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over cross countries.

Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
