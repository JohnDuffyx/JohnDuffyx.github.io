When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and vehicles.</p>
