There's two-way talking, quick responses to remote commands, fast zooming, and an adjustable field of view.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
