<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
