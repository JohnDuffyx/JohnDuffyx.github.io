<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see precisely when a specific individual gets to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has actually expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to introduce a clever smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even better proposal.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies widely depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
