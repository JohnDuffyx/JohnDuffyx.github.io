<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection devices are developed to safeguard specific, concrete properties, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and household heirlooms. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated. The sensing unit will activate an alarm if the product to which the gadget has been connected is moved or disrupted.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
