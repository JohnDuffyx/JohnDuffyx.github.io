To hold and recover expenses alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and supply physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to warrant cops response.</p>
