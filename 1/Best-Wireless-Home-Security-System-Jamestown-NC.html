<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring.
