All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such incidents. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not believe that these problems change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is necessary. In reality, we don't recommend buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and an individual, for instance, enables you to reduce unneeded informs. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
