<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
