<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

These companies created their equipment in this manner to make clients stay with them longer, since changing monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. Alexa assistance is consisted of, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera effectively handles all the usual functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights go out. </p>
