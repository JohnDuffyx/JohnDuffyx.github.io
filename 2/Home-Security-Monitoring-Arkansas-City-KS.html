<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
