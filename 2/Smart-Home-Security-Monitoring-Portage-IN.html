<p>Nevertheless, in any situation where standard-definition camera are used, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines however the results are the very same); they usually catch vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Home security companies provide a wide variety of equipment options, from installed control panel setups to completely automated systems managed by tablets or smartphones. Some companies make and offer their own exclusive equipment, while others depend on third-party products. Particular home security systems need professional installation.

<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer service experience varies extensively depending on the dealership you go with. </p>
