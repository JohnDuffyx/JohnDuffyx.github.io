<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. However suicide assailants are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the limited advantages that the system might offer in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed professional installation.

Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing games for a very long time and a great deal of the stuff in earlier games I've played a decade ago would definitely NEVER EVER make it in todays politically charged gaming environment.</p>
