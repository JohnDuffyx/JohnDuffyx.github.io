The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks.

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
