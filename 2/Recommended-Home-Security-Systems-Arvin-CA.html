<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set quantity of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
