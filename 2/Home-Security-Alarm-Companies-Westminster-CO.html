<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
