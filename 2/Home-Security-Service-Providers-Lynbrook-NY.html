<p>Nevertheless, in any scenario where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the outcomes are the exact same); they normally catch vertical and horizontal fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
