<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't believe that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
