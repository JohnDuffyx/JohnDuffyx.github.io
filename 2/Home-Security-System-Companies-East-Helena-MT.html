<h2>ACT Government Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Camera Systems East Helena</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
