<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole household will enjoy. If you want a reliable home security camera for both inside and out that does not cost excessive, you can't beat the Arlo Pro 2. This 1080p camera has a large 130-degree field of view, night vision, and more. It can be plugged in or run off battery power, and can last for up to 6 months without needing a recharge. It has both a microphone and a speaker, so you can speak to whoever you see in front of the camera.</p>
<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might review this review.</p>

<p>A smart lock is usually part of a robust smart home security setup, but you don't have to invest in a full-blown system to utilize one. If you're utilizing a home automation hub to manage things like lighting and thermostats, you can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee clever lock to the system without much effort. Alternately, if you do not have a home automation center, look for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are fairly simple to install. Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
