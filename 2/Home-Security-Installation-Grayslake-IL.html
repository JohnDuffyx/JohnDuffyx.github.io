<h3>Alarm House System Grayslake IL 60030</h3>

I have actually dropped my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has spotted trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens may breach local sound control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If catching video footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
