<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
