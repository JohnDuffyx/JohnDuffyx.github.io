<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, assurance and fulfillment to every client and are dedicated to satisfying our client's needs with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's typically skewed by elements such as skepticism over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms. While improvements in recent years have actually made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
