<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
