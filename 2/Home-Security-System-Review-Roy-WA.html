<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to up to 20 relative. However, shared monitoring isn't a function available from all companies. If this is a high concern, make certain to investigate the company's features or talk with a representative directly. Reacting to incorrect alarms can needlessly cost Sumner - and its taxpayers - cash each year. In addition, officers reacting to these incorrect alarms are not able to react to real emergencies or perform preventative patrols.</p>
