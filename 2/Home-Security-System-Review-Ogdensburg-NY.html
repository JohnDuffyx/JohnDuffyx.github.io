So prior to you drill holes in your walls or otherwise screw up your doorframe, siding or brick, examine your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll observe substantial lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other hold-ups that make security cameras a discomfort to use.</p>
