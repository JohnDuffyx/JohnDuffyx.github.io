For beginners, it looks lovely: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you imagine a home security camera, it's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
