The square-shaped Arlo Q requires to be plugged into a power outlet and isn't water resistant, however it's the best camera for monitoring the interior of your house or apartment.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing period).
