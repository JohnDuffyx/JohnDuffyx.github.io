<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store.
