<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of as much as one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have seen some improvements because the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this evaluation and evaluate, as needed.</p>
<p>If you use Alexa to manage the clever lights in your home, then you ought to consider checking out Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a couple of neat tricks. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply state, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you leave the door to activate it. From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it look like you're home - and you'll also get a notification if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
<p>We do not love the rate. Vivint's monthly monitoring service strategies aren't too costly, but its equipment costs a quite cent. Prepare to pay out several hundred dollars for just your starter kit. Fobs and keypads - Some smart alarms feature keypads and fobs that make equipping and disarming the alarm simpler than via the smart device app. This might be useful if you have dog walkers, cleaners or others that may let themselves in and out of your home when you're not there.</p>

Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
