<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
