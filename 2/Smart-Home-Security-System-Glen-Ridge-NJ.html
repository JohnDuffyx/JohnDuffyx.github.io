<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It also implies that if you in fact saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly tape a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud.
