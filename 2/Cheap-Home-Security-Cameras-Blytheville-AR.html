<p>Think of it in this manner, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars? It simply does not add up. To offer such low prices, producers must cut corners, and completion outcome is compromised performance. What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in perfect conditions like intense sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific circumstances such as nanny webcams or checking in on an animal, though when aiming to gather evidence of a criminal offense they frequently come up short.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
