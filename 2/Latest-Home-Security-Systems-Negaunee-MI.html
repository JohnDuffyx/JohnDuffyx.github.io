<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone informs with that info when they appear at your home.
