<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are various because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
