It will tape-record clips when it views movement (and a couple of seconds before so you get the complete view of what happened) and you can view these for a week prior to they're erased.

When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that details when they appear at your home.
