<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store.
