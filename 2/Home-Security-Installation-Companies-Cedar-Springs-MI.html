<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
