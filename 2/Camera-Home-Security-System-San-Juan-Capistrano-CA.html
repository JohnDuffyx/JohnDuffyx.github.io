<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly.

Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and calling leading researchers to inquire about forthcoming assessments. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
