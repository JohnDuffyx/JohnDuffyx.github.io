<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
