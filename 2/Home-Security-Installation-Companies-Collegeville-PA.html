<p>The other significant choice when choosing a home security camera is whether you need an outdoor or indoor camera. Outdoor cameras will often be constructed to be more resilient and able to endure rain, frost, or damp.

<p>Having animals means you will need to consider their size, movements, and any other aspects that might trigger problems. For instance, if you have family pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensors can be adjusted or a system that can be set up in such a way that your big pets will not cause false alarms to be sent out whenever your family pet moves. If you have big animals, you may want to think about skipping the motion sensors and rely more on the doors and window sensing units which aren't triggered by motion but are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>

<p>A wired security camera can can be found in 2 forms, both requiring wires to provide power and for the functions of video transmission. The camera's viewing angle determines how much area the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses minimize the number of cameras needed to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might reveal a 360-degree view, however the very best security cameras have a view of a minimum of 100 degrees or better.</p>
<p>Do you desire a camera to discourage burglars, or are you more interested in keeping an eye on kids or family pets?
