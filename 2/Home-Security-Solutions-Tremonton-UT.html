<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, due to the fact that apparently they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

<h3>Home Security Systems In My Area in Utah</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

More than 98 percent of all burglar and property alarms ultimately prove to be incorrect alarms.</p>
