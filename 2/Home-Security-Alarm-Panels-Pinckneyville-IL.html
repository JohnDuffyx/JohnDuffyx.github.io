<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensors discovered in household and small company environments. It offers budget friendly and reliable performance. The term passive refers to the reality that the detector does not create or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by spotting the heat energy emitted by other objects. </p>
