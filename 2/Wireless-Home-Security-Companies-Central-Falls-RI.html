<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
