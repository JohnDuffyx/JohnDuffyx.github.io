<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was created for homeowners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, when set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large homes and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your home. The team will be able to recycle the existing wiring if you have actually already installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system.
