Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your home.
