When a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
