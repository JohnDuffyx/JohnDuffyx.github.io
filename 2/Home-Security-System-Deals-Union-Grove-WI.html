Many people who? consider it correct rules to leave access points open up to the public, allowing free access to Web. Others who? think the default file encryption supplies considerable protection at small inconvenience, versus dangers of open access that they fear might be significant even on a home DSL router.</p>
<p>If you utilize Alexa to control the clever lights in your home, then you need to consider trying Alexa Guard, a relatively new home security mode with a number of neat techniques. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply say, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you walk out the door to trigger it.
