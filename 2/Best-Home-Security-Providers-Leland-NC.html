<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT irritates us. We see many growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer support experience differs widely depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
