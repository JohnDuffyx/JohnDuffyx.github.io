<h3>Home Security System Service in Maryland</h3>
<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensing units had actually been set off.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
