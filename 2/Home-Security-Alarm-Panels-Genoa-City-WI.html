<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has discovered trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick.

If you do buy them, first examine the suppliers return policy and 2nd keep the receipt.</p>
