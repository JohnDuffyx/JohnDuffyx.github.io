Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
