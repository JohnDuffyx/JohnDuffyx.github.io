<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion.
