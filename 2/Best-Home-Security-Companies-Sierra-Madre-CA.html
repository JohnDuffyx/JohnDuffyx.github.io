<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off).

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
