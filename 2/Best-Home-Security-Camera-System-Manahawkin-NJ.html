<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
