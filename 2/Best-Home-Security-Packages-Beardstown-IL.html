<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
