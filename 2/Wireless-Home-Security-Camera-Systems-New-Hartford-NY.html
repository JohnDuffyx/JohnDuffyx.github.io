With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway.

<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much suffices.

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
