<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
