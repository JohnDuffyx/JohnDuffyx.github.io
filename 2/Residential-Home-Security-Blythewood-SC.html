<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system finds a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it notifies the security team and, sometimes, emergency responders. Regrettably, history has shown that surveillance innovations put in location for one function inevitably broaden into other uses. And with video technology most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems ought to have the ability to do positions a significant risk.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out mobile phone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
