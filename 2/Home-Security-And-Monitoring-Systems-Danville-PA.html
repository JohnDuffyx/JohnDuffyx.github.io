<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send informs, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
