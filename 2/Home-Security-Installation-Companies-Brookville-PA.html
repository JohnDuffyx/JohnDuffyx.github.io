<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very affordable, so it's not an overall splurge.

<h2>Video Surveillance Systems Brookville</h2>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
