The main claim to fame that wired security companies have is that the systems can be more reliable than a wireless system. Considering that the system is wired into your home, it does not need to rely on a wi-fi network in order to relay information. Rather of using wi-fi, a wired system works like a landline.</p>

<p>Costs for systems differ. Larger systems that provide full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget friendly option. Remember that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.
