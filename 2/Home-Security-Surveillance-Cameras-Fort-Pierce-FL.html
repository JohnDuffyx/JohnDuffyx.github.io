<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
