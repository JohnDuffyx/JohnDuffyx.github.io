<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
