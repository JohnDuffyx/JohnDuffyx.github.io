<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.

We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
