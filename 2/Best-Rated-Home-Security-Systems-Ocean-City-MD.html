The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>A subsidiary of Amazon, Ring's Alarm security set fasts to install and easy to use. Aside from a new "Works with Ring" program to bring compatible wise locks and other third-party devices into the fold, there's nothing all that ingenious about it, though Amazon Alexa users will appreciate the two-way voice feature, that they can deactivate the system and equip using voice commands and that they can use Ring's sensors to trigger Amazon Alexa routines.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
