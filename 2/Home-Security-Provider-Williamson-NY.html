Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All items give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of discovering tiny differences in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level distinctions. Because things are rarely specifically the same temperature level as other items around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
