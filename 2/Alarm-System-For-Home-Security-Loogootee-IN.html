<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
