<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has plainly attempted to provide it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from up to four cameras at a time. It can be awkward and sluggish to utilize on celebration - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid sometimes. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have actually a cable connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit simpler to sabotage for potential intruders.
