<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously restricts your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home devices like lights, thermostats, locks, and outlets.

<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically reroute the field of view without remounting the security camera whenever. They're fantastic for storage facilities. Some of these might look like dome cameras, but there's a basic trick to identify them - if the lens and the IR LEDs are in front of the glass on the real estate rather than contained behind it, you have actually got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send mobile phone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
