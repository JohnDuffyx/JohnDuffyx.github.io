Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that can detecting tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Because things are hardly ever precisely the exact same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for recording a burglar in the act, however. They're also beneficial for casual home monitoring. Put on countertops, racks, and tables, they permit you to keep an eye on what your animals are doing, understand when the kids come home from school, or discover who's been striking the liquor cabinet. Many even permit you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is happening, through an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can compare general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
