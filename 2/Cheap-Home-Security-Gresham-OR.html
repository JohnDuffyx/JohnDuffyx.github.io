<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
