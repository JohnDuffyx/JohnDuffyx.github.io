Non-traditional networks such as individual network Bluetooth devices are not safe from hacking and should be considered a security threat. Even barcode readers, portable PDAs, and wireless printers and photo copiers must be secured. These non-traditional networks can be quickly overlooked by IT personnel who have directly concentrated on laptop computers and access points.</p>
