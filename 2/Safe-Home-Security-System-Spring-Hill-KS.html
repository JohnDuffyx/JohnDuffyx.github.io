<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government centers, and residential customers. Non-traditional networks such as individual network Bluetooth devices are not safe from hacking and should be considered a security threat. Even barcode readers, portable PDAs, and wireless printers and photo copiers must be secured. These non-traditional networks can be quickly overlooked by IT personnel who have directly concentrated on laptop computers and access points.</p>

<p>Thank you guys for the assistance, what great client servcie you use. I purchased a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am quite convenient to install it myself.

They even recalled, the next day to check that whatever was still on track.</p>
<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hours a day.
