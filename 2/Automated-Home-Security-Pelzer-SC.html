The very first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unavailable or reluctant to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
