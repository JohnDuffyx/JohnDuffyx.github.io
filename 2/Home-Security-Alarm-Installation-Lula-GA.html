<p>The San Diego Cops Department intended to gain access to footage from public and personal cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program Since 2014, the program was filled with software application compatibility problems, and officers had trouble seeing video footage in real time due to the fact that the department's patrol car did not have a 4G connection. The city has since embraced a new partnership with General Electric in which street lights are geared up with cameras and microphones.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm but you remain in a meeting with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service indicates you do not get signaled up until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise might scare off would-be burglars-- if you're fortunate. But the cops will not come till you personally call them. </p>
