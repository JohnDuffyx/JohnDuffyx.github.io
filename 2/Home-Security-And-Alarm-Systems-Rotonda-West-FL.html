<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
