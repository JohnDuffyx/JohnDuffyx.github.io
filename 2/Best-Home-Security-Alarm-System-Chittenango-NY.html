Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
