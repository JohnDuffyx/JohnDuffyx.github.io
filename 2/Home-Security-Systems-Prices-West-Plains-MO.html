<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smartphone informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
