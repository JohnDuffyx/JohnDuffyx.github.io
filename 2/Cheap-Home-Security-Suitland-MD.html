<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see specifically when a particular person comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to introduce a clever smoke alarm and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
