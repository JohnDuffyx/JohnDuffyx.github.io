<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built files supplying performance and configuration details to make this integration work, there are only two options. The very first alternative, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unavailable or reluctant to supply those details) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
