<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances.

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
