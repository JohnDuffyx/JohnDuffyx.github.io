<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
