<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
