<p>The Kasa Camera Outdoor KC200 provides strong security efficiency and simple installation at an inexpensive price.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
