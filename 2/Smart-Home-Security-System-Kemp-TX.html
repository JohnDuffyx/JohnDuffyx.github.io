Despite that, the alarm needs to suffice to frighten intruders in most cases.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about.

A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
