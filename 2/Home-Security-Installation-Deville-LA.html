<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". According to a report released by the Urban Institute, police departments across the country react to millions of incorrect alarms from resident and business security systems every year. This costs cities and towns millions of dollars in wasted police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is easy and trusted to utilize, but costly and eccentric unless you want the benefit of a professional install and maintenance.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and typically onerous agreements, and frequently rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed separately and do not suggest for the majority of people.</p>

<p>Despite if you pick a month-to-month professional monitoring plan or choose to self-monitor your home, SimpliSafe requires you to purchase its equipment upfront.
