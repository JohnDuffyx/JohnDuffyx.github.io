<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

However, there were some issues with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
