<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition.

We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
