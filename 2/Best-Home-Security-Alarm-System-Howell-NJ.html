<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current suggestion.</p>
