<p>During our screening, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look.

We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm system has 4 intelligent modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending on your place. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that lessens all blind areas and offers you access to a larger field of view than many cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that enables you to zoom in and catch information such as facial functions in case of burglaries.</p>
