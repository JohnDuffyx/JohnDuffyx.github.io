Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
