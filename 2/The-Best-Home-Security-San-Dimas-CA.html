'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the same individual could put a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the personal privacy of their home.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
