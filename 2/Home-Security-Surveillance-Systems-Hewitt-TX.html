<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
