<p>Condo associations might prohibit residents from drilling holes in exterior walls. Residents of these dwellings may be much better off using a wireless security system.

They can choose wired or wireless systems without much inconvenience.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place frequently enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
