The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are plainly not prevented by camera - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far exceeds the limited advantages that the system may supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
