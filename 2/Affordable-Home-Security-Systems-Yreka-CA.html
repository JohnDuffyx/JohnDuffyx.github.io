<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
