<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
