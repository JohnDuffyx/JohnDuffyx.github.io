<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit less expensive than the wireless systems. While this might appear appealing in the beginning, think about all of the drawbacks to the wired systems that we've currently discussed. Answering the question Who's at my door this time?" has never been much easier. Whether you're home or away, you can check your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
