The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are plainly not deterred by camera - and might even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system might provide in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
