<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All items release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it gives off.

The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature level differences. Because things are seldom specifically the very same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
