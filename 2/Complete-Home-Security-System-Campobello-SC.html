It was exceptionally simple to set up, as the components are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to set off when any of the sensing units were activated. We love that it comes with both internal and external sirens and will even work with Philips Shade smart lights, too.

The alarm system does not include a wifi security camera but you can purchase a number of different Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional extras. There's no external monitoring choice with this alarm.</p>
