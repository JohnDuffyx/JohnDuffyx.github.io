However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
