It can be slow and awkward to utilize on event - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have actually a cable attached though, rather than working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit easier to mess up for prospective burglars.
