With some, it's hard to tell at a look where they've been intended, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their true field of vision. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a great choice for a number of various setups.</p>
<p>These cameras do not need a video capture card since they work utilizing a digital signal which can be conserved directly to a computer system. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture required or desired). The greatest image quality of DVD is only slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
