<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning numerous years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets.
