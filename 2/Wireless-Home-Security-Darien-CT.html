<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
