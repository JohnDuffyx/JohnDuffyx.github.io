<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer support experience differs extensively depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
