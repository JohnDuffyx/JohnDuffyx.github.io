<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the restricted series of sensing units. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet.

<p>If you're trying to find motion detection, the Canary Flex includes a smart version that sends out notifies straight to your phone. This camera provides a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the road.
