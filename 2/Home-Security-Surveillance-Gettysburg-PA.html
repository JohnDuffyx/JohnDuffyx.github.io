<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we concur with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events.

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide.
