<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.

It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see specifically when a specific individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to introduce a wise smoke alarm and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
