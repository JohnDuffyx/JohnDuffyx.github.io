One typical location is near a dumpster-an employee may get rid of the stolen goods just to recover them later on or send out an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can prevent this activity.</p>

False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place regularly enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
