With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
