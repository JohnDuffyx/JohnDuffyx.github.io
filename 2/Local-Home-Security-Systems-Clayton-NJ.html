We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion.
