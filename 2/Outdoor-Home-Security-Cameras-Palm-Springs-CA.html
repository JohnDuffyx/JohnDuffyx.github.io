<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and scams.

When you're at home and don't want to be taped, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets set off while you're away, you have no visual methods of validating if something is in fact wrong and how severe the scenario is.

<p>This is the best-scoring wise alarm we tested. It was exceptionally basic to establish, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it was quick to trigger when any of the sensors were activated.

<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then transmitted over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Recording the video from your security cameras needs hard disk drives or cloud based storage. If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are linked to has a hard disk inside of it. If your handling tape-recorded video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use disk drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in case of disk drive breakdown.</p>
